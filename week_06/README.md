# TinyZero with A*-PO: Teaching AI to Reason Through Reinforcement Learning

A complete implementation of **TinyZero** using **A*-PO** (A-star Policy Optimization) for teaching language models mathematical reasoning through pure reinforcement learning—no supervised fine-tuning required.

---

##  Overview

This project demonstrates how a base language model can learn complex reasoning tasks using only reinforcement learning rewards. Starting from a pre-trained base model with minimal reasoning ability, we use A*-PO to teach the model to:
- Solve multiplication problems with step-by-step reasoning
- Solve countdown number puzzles
- Format answers using structured `<think>` and `<answer>` tags
- Self-correct through iterative refinement

**Key Innovation**: TinyZero eliminates the need for expensive critic networks by estimating optimal values (V*) directly from reference model samples, making RL training dramatically more efficient.

---

## What is TinyZero?

**TinyZero** is a simplified reproduction of DeepSeek-R1's reinforcement learning approach, adapted for educational purposes and resource-constrained environments. It teaches language models to reason through:

1. **Self-Verification**: Model generates multiple solution attempts
2. **Value Estimation**: Reference model samples estimate optimal performance (V*)
3. **Advantage Learning**: Policy learns to prefer solutions that exceed V*
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Model progressively learns better reasoning strategies

### Core Algorithms

**A*-PO Training Step**:
```python
# 1. Estimate V* from reference model
V* = estimate_optimal_value(reference_model, prompt)

# 2. Generate from policy
response = policy_model.generate(prompt)

# 3. Compute advantage
advantage = reward(response) - V*

# 4. Update policy with advantage weighting
weight = (normalized(advantage) + 1.0).clamp(0.1, 5.0)
loss = cross_entropy(response) * weight
```

##  Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- CUDA-capable GPU (H100 recommended)
- 24GB+ GPU memory for 3B model
- Modal account (for cloud training)

### Local Installation
```bash
# Clone and navigate
cd week_06

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
python -c "from tinyzero import rewards, apo_trainer; print('✓ Installation successful!')"
```

### Cloud Setup (Modal)
```bash
# Install Modal CLI
pip install modal

# Authenticate
modal token new

# Deploy training
modal run modal_train.py
```

---

##  Usage

### Basic Training
```bash
python -m tinyzero.train \
    --config configs/modal_config.yaml \
    --output_dir outputs/
```

### Training on Modal (Recommended)
```bash
# Single command deployment
modal run modal_train.py

# Monitor in real-time
modal app logs tinyzero-training

# Download results
modal volume get tinyzero-outputs best_model.pt ./results/
```

### Debug Mode

Quick test with reduced dataset:
```bash
python -m tinyzero.train \
    --config configs/modal_config.yaml \
    --debug
```

### Resume from Checkpoint
```bash
python -m tinyzero.train \
    --config configs/modal_config.yaml \
    --resume outputs/checkpoint_100.pt
```

---

##  Configuration

### Model Settings
```yaml
model:
  name: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B"          # Base model (not instruct!)
  ref_model: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B"      # Reference model
  max_length: 256                   # Generation length
  device: "cuda"
```

**Why Base Model?** Unlike instruct models, base models haven't been aligned to follow instructions, making them better candidates for learning reasoning through RL from scratch.

### A*-PO Hyperparameters
```yaml
apo:
  beta: 0.5                         # V* temperature
  v_star_samples: 5                 # Samples for V* estimation
  adaptive_vstar: true              # Enable 5→3→2 sampling
  learning_rate: 3e-7               # Conservative for stability
  batch_size: 4                     # Effective batch: 16 (4×4 grad accum)
  kl_coef: 0.03                     # KL regularization
  adv_clip: 2.0                     # Advantage clipping
  weighting_scheme: "normalized_advantage"
```

**Key Insight**: Adaptive V* sampling reduces compute by 20-30% by using fewer samples (5→3→2) as training progresses and the model improves.

### Curriculum Learning
```yaml
# Difficulty progression (for 250 steps)
# Steps 0-79: very_easy (32%)
# Steps 80-179: easy (40%)  
# Steps 180-219: medium (16%)
# Steps 220-250: hard (12%)
```

Curriculum automatically increases problem difficulty, allowing the model to build foundational skills before tackling complex problems.

##  Optimizations (70%+ Cost Savings!)

We implemented several optimizations to stay within the $30 Modal budget:

### 1. V* Caching
- **Saves**: 30-40% compute
- **How**: Reuses V* computations for identical prompts across training steps
- **Impact**: Cache hit rate of 25-100% observed

### 2. Adaptive V* Sampling
- **Saves**: +20% compute
- **How**: Reduces samples from 5→3→2 as model improves
- **Rationale**: Early training needs accurate V*, later training can use fewer samples

### 3. Batch Computation
- **Saves**: +15% compute
- **How**: Parallelizes V* sample generation
- **Impact**: Better GPU utilization

### 4. Reduced Evaluation Frequency
- **Saves**: +15% compute
- **How**: Evaluate every 50 steps instead of 25
- **Trade-off**: Less frequent feedback, but sufficient for monitoring

**Total Savings**: ~70-80% of original compute cost, making $30 budget effectively $100-150!

##  Key Implementation Details

### Reward Function

We use **process-based rewards** with partial credit:
```python
Reward Scheme:
- 1.0: Correct answer + proper format + good reasoning
- 0.8: Correct answer + proper format, weak reasoning
- 0.6: Correct answer + good reasoning, wrong format
- 0.5: Correct answer only
- 0.3: Wrong answer + proper format + reasoning attempt
- 0.0: Wrong answer, no format, no reasoning
```

This encourages the model to learn both the correct answer AND the reasoning process.

### Format Requirements

Models are trained to output:
```
<think>
Step-by-step reasoning here...
</think>
<answer>
Final answer here
</answer>
```

### Few-Shot Prompting

Each problem includes an example to guide format:
```
Example: What is 5 × 3?
<think>
I need to multiply 5 by 3.
This means adding 5 three times: 5 + 5 + 5
Let me calculate:
5 + 5 = 10
10 + 5 = 15
Therefore, 5 × 3 = 15
</think>
<answer>15</answer>

Now solve: What is 7 × 9?
```

##  Training Insights

### What We Learned

1. **Base vs Instruct Models**: Base models show clearer learning curves but require more training steps. Initial accuracy (80%) reflects effective few-shot design rather than RL improvement.

2. **Curriculum Learning**: Progressive difficulty is critical. Models master easy problems before advancing to harder ones.

3. **V* Caching**: Massive compute savings with minimal accuracy impact. Cache hit rates reached 100% for repeated prompts.

4. **Adaptive Sampling**: Reducing V* samples from 5→3→2 saved 20% compute without hurting accuracy.

5. **Format Compliance**: Few-shot examples are highly effective at teaching structured output formats to base models.

### Challenges Encountered

- **Mode Collapse**: Early experiments without `min_new_tokens` caused models to generate empty responses. Fixed by enforcing minimum generation length.

- **Weight Vanishing**: Zero-valued weights prevented gradient flow. Solved by clamping weights to `min=0.1`.

- **Prompt Length**: Initial few-shot examples exceeded token limits. Optimized by balancing example detail with length constraints.

##  Results & Analysis

### Accuracy Breakdown

| Task | Initial | Peak | Improvement |
|------|---------|------|-------------|
| **Overall** | 80% | 84% | +4% |
| **Countdown** | 80% | 90% | +10% |
| **Multiplication** | 80% | 75% | -5%  |

**Insights**:
- Countdown tasks benefited more from RL training
- Multiplication showed high variance—some problems solved perfectly, others failed
- Few-shot prompting provides strong baseline (80% initial)

### Sample Outputs

**Correct Example (Reward: 1.0)**:
```
Prompt: What is 8 × 9?

Output:
<think>
I need to multiply 8 by 9.
This means adding 8 nine times: 8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8
Let me calculate:
8+8=16, 16+8=24, 24+8=32, 32+8=40
40+8=48, 48+8=56, 56+8=64, 64+8=72
Therefore, 8 × 9 = 72
</think>
<answer>72</answer>
```

**Incorrect Example (Reward: 0.0)**:
```
Prompt: What is 4 × 7?

Output:
<think>
I will use the standard multiplication algorithm...
4 × 7 = 28, but I will add the 2 I carried...
</think>
<answer>328</answer>

Issue: Hallucinated a "carry" operation (none exists for single-digit multiplication)
```

## Technical Deep Dive

### A*-PO Algorithm

Unlike GRPO (which requires multiple rollouts per prompt), A*-PO estimates V* offline:
```
GRPO:
- Generate K rollouts per prompt
- Compute advantages from all K rollouts
- Update policy
- Cost: O(K × generation_cost)

A*-PO:
- Compute V* once from reference model
- Generate 1 rollout per prompt
- Compute advantage vs V*
- Update policy
- Cost: O(1 × generation_cost) + V* overhead

With caching: V* overhead → 0
Effective cost: O(1 × generation_cost)
```

**Result**: 3-5x more sample efficient than GRPO!

### Advantage Weighting
```python
# Normalized advantages for stability
advantages = rewards - V_star
adv_norm = (advantages - advantages.mean()) / advantages.std()
adv_norm = adv_norm.clamp(-2.0, 2.0)

# Shift to positive weights (prevents negative loss contributions)
weights = (adv_norm + 1.0).clamp(min=0.1, max=5.0)

# Weighted loss
loss = (cross_entropy_loss * weights).mean()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Model generates empty responses (`"..."`)
```bash
Solution: Verify min_new_tokens=30 in models.py
Check: grep "min_new_tokens" tinyzero/models.py
```

**Problem**: Training stops at 100 steps instead of 250
```bash
Solution: Set num_epochs: 3 in config
250 steps = 3 epochs × ~83 batches/epoch
```

**Problem**: Rewards stuck at 0.0
```bash
Solution: Base model needs more steps (wait until step 100+)
Or: Check if reward function is being called correctly
```

**Problem**: Mode collapse (accuracy drops to 0%)
```bash
Solution: Ensure weights.clamp(min=0.1) to prevent zero gradients
Check: grep "clamp(min=0.1" tinyzero/apo_trainer.py
```
